                I am coming from a different academic background, from the world of humanities, with an eye for well-built, user-friendly, experience driven UIâ€™s. On the other hand, I also like simple-but-classy websites, which are simple to use with great functionality. I truly believe that a website that an end user had a great experience with, is not being left after the purchase or the visit.
                To learn the basics of front end web development, I used resources that are available online. I also enrolled to Introduction to Computer Science (CS50) online university course provided by Harvard University to deepen my knowledge in algorithms, programming in general.
